Welcome to my Github Portfolio

This is a selection of my projects sorted by year.

Most of these are intended for Unity3D, if you want to look at the code, you will usually find the Scripts directory in Assets/Resources/Scripts or a similar file-structure.

2019
- AStarPathfinding_TestRig
	The AI core of a game project I've been working on for some time off-and-on. The Pathfinder works quite well though it could do with some polishing. The rest is decision-tree mechanisms. 
The goals of this project were to create a working Pathfinding algorithm that I could apply to projects in future, and to create a decision-making AI based on Needs and Wants.
I think it worked okay.

- Running Frog
	This was an effort to make a simplistic 2D side-scrolling game. All the artwork is placeholder. Notably I spent some time playing around with Unity's 2D sprite animation mechanics.
The only missing game-mechanic is the actual collision-detection with the obstacles

2016
- Bubble Raider level editor
	When I worked for Playdemand, I was in charge of making the levels for Bubbleraider and its spinoffs. Every few months or so, I'd have to make 100 more levels in the space of a couple weeks and it was tedious as hell. So eventually, I got tired of asking for resources to make a level editor and built one for myself.
This editor takes a copy of the level file and modifies it in-line with the editor before saving it back to the original location.
This turned the level-design task from being 10 working days to being about three.
